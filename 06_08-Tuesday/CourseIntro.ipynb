    "The bootcamp covers two main themes: Python basics and visualization basics. We will then break into small groups for a group project which you get to choose the dataset you wish to analyze.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, we want to say we are excited to have you here (yes even virtually)! The goal of this bootcamp is so that you can learn some space science specific computional skills, but also get used to working virtually on research. You are all coming in with various skillsets and levels of experience. You are in this REU because we value what you bring from your experiences, but also because the REU program managers wants to work *with* you! This program isn't designed to test or assess your skillsets, but provide an opportunity for you to explore the professions in space sciences and get hands on experience in research in this field. \n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare you for the summer, this bootcamp then will cover some things which might seem basic and some which most likely you have not seen before. This is designed to provide you a generalized introduction so you can hit the ground running when you begin to work with your mentor. \n",
