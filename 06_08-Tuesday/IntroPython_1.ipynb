    "## A Quick Review\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python and why are we using it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. This means it has 'objects' which have certain rules or methods which you can access to run computer programming. We've seen this as we use pandas dataframes (objects) to analyze data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a interactive environment (this \"notebook\") where we can explore how a programming language ie Python works. You can \"run\" various cells at a time by hitting shift-enter OR by hitting run after selecting a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "To edit a cell: double click. \n",
    "To make a text box cell: use the Cell -> Markdown option\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the JupyterHub?\n",
    "\n",
    "The hub we are currently on allows us to compute \"in the cloud\". By that it means that each notebook is being run through Amazon Web Services. The details are less important than essentially it means that your computer doesn't need to have any Python installed to be running our current code. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What will we do in this notebook: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be using a solar dataset (related to the sun) to understand long duration time behavior of the sun and it's impact on the Earth. Let's begin!\n",
