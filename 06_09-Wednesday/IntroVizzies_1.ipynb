    "### What is Python and why are we using it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented programming language. This means it has 'objects' which have certain rules or methods which you can access to run computer programming. We've seen this as we use pandas dataframes (objects) to analyze data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is a interactive environment (this \"notebook\") where we can explore how a programming language ie Python works. You can \"run\" various cells at a time by hitting shift-enter OR by hitting run after selecting a cell. \n",
